By the waters of Egypt.,"A professional writer of travel tales, Lorimer writes in the form of letters home that seem to be simply a literary device. Her trip from Alexandria to Wadi Haifa, with side trips to the Libyan oases, is a fairly common description. Includes some moments of humor: ""By this time the different people in our 'Cook party' are beginning to mean something to me.

Cairo and its environs.,"Lamplough, an English architectural painter, concentrated on North African scenes from early on in his career. Lamplough traveled from Alexandria to Aswan, but concentrates on Cairo in this book. The streets, shops, and Europeans in Egypt are his main subjects. “Everything along the road that leads to Old Cairo and Roda Island emphasizes the climax of destruction and modernity in Cairo,” p. 52. The illustrations by Lamplough (colored prints from paintings) are interesting, but the text only average.

The Khedive’s farewell to me was most touching in its heartfelt kindness: and to me it was a real sorrow to part from him and from the little princes. Like all who have ever been in the personal service of the Khedive, I retain for him a feeling of loyal devotion, and I have no patience with the ignorant malice of those in England who slander him,” p. 297.

Still, Low does not totally forget the purpose of his book, and gives a fascinating account of Egypt: ""Egypt, then, for a certain number of weeks in the winter is a tourist land, and such, under all political and social vicissitudes, it is hkely to remain. Whether this is wholly an advantage to the country may be doubted. The visitors bring in some money, but only a small portion is left to 'fructify within the pockets of the people.' Perhaps two millions sterling are spent in Egypt each year between December and March.

Egypt of yesterday and to-day.,"A good, basic account of the antiquities of Egypt (including a very good section on the temple at Philae: ""All around, in every direction, is havoc and loss.
